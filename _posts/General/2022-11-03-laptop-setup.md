title: Setting up for success

After any length of time spent studying (either formally or informally) Computer Sciences and programming, you will 
eventually have to make a choice regarding what sort of environment you want to develop in. If you are anything like me, this choice normally comes around the time
that you have experimented with a number of IDEs, Programming Languages and made your current Laptop/Desktop a mess of 
scattered files and unused installations (looking at you Visual Studios). Recently I found myself in this position and so
during a week off from work decided to take the plunge and completely reset my laptop.

## Background - How did we get here 

Buckle up, its story time.

Back in 2018 when I began my Computer Sciences Undergraduate Degree at the University of Pretoria, I was working on a fairly 
modest Lenovo laptop (Intel I3, 8 GB Ram etc). This was fine for first year, since most of the projects we had to work on 
could easily be done in an Arch Linux setup running in Virtual Box, which my laptop was fine with. That being said, as time passed
my laptop did slow down and the time between switching my laptop on and actually being able to begin programming could often reach 8-10 minutes long.
Not great, but I managed to work around it.

Fastforward to my second year and suddenly the issue became more pronounced. In COS216 (essentially a Web Development Module)
there were suddenly greater demands on my poor laptop. This problem came to a head in one particular week when we were given 
exactly one week to setup and use Android Studios to develop a mobile version of the Website we had been developing thus far
in that module. What made my predicament worse was that we were given this assignment on a Monday, but I was due to write 
a multivariable calculus semester test that Friday since I took this as an extra subject. So inn reality, I had 2 days to complete 
the project.

On Saturday morning I sat down and began installing Android Studios. After beginning the process, I made a cup of tea and began waiting for the 
installation to complete, and continued waiting, and waiting, and waiting. If I recall correctly, I ran out of time 
on the Saturday waiting since I had other commitments to work on and had to try again on the Sunday. This time I was able to install 
Android Studios (after 2+ hours), but the new issue I ran into was actually running it, which ate up another 2 hours 
of my time. Eventually late on Sunday afternoon I resigned myself to the fact that the incredibly basic app I had managed to generate 
would have to do and decided to have a nap instead. 

## Upgrading my rig

Given the experiences I had in the first Semester of Second Year, I decided that enough was enough and with the support of 
my dad (who was persuaded by my previous academic performance) I procured a new laptop: an Asus Tuf Gaming Laptop (GTX 1050, i7, 8GB Ram).
In my excitement I decided that it was time to dual boot Windows and Linux since I was sick of using Virtual Machines and 
wanted to join the Linux Master Race. There were 3 problems though:

1. I had never done this before 
2. I was attempting to do this while I needed a laptop for my coursework 
3. My laptop had a 128GB SSD on which Windows was installed, and a 1TB HD for normal storage 

To cut a long story short, I tried to install Ubuntu on the HD but ran into issues in which Windows 
stopped working. Given that I had limited time to do this before I had to get back to my course work, I panicked and instead 
of burning more time on this, I instead opted to just be 
content with Windows and leave the dual booting for another day. Maybe I became a little too content with Windows,
since I never felt the need to switch over to Linux until after completing my undergraduate degree.

## And that brings us to today 

This year I have become far more knowledgeable on Linux, File Systems and OS troubleshooting in general. Based on this (and the fact 
that I was sick and tired of having no space on my 128 GB C drive) I felt it was time to finish what I started. I should 
mention that I had by this time replaced my 1TB Hard Drive with a 1TB SSD, and so wanted to make that my main drive. It was 
also around time for me to clean up my laptop and start anew with a fresh install. 

Initially I decided to try out Fedora, but found that I didn't quite like its UI and so opted to stick to what I am most comfortable
with and install Ubuntu. Maybe one day I will join the Arch Linux Master Race, but that day is not today. 

## Conclusion

What lessons can be drawn from this story? Maybe that it's best to wait until you know what you want and how to get it before 
committing to a particular option. Maybe that you shouldn't try and fix something that isn't broken (and especially not when
you really need that particular thing for your coursework). I am not sure, but I am glad now that I have a clean and efficient 
environment to work on projects and prepare for an upcoming programming interview (which I will write about another time).
