### About me
 I was born in Johannesburg South Africa and have lived here all my life. Growing up, I tried my best to do anything and everything that I could. I have played violin, guitar, chess, rugby, competed in fishing, athletics, cross country and sung in my old school's choir. As of right now my passions lie in long distance running, mountain biking and martial arts. In my spare time I also enjoy reading, playing games and sending memes to my friends. 
 
 I am currently in my 3rd year of studying Computer Sciences at The University of Pretoria. 
 
### My skills
In general, I far prefer backend work to frontend work. Although I am able to work with html, css and Ionic I find I enjoy work that is more involved with problem solving and algorithms than visual appearance. The technologies I am most comfortable with are listed below.

On a more personal level, I am a great team player and a strong leader. I find it easy to talk to and work with others and can keep a cool head under pressure. 
 
### My interests
My interests tend to lean towards more theoretical aspects of Computer Sciences. I am deeply interested in Compiler Construction, but also have found myself researching Security, Mathematics and Problem Solving in my own time. I also find myself drawn to developing silly discord bots for my friends. 
 
### My Current Work
 My current focus is on my studies. If you would like to collaborate on a project however, please feel free to send me an email.
